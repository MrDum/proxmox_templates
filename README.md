This script will download a bunch of premade cloud images from the most common Linux distributions and add them as new 900-numbered VM templates, import your SSH keys, and configure the VM how I like it as a template. Of course, feel free to change any of the settings in the script before you run it, and youâ€™ll need to add your public key in a plain text file and set your username.
